    <h3>Data Engineer</h3>

    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I have 6 years of experience working as data engineer in different stages.</p>
    
    <p>I started this journey of data engineering working as Business Intelligence Analyst collecting information with SQL to tranform data into valuable insights or to highlight behaviors related to key performance indicators, after that I moved into reporting development based on Microsoft eco-system, I used to build reports in Power BI, Excel and SSRS my daily basis was build queries, denormalize tables into data sets, design and create reports with basic UX/UI knowledge, after that I undestand that information flow is the keys in every software solution, that is why I started to study database development, later that I worked as ETL programmer, database troubleshooting with SSMS and topics related with entity diagram, relational diagram, job sequences, master data, indexes, all this experience bring me here, now I am an industrial engineer that understands how important is set the correct flow of information to create value from analysis.</p>
      
    <p>I consider myself as detail oriented, recursive, self-taught and challenge facer, skills that will keep me growing into software engineering field.
    </p>

    <p>My strongest technical skills are T-SQL, database administration and tunning, pipeline designs including ETL or ELT, smart reports with minimalism designs.</p>
