        <p>I started this journey of data engineering working as Business Intelligence Analyst collecting information with SQL to tranform data into valuable insights or to highlight behaviors related to key performance indicators, after that I moved into reporting development based on Microsoft eco-system, I used to build reports in Power BI, Excel and SSRS my daily basis was build queries, denormalize tables into data sets, design and create reports with basic UX/UI knowledge, after that I undestand that information flow is the keys in every software solution, that is why I started to study database development, later I worked as ETL programmer, database troubleshooting with SSMS and topics related with entity or relational database diagram, also check problems or optimize the pipelines and job sequences, manage and build the relational diagram for master data models, also database tunning like declare indexes, safety tips and non redundancy tests, all this experience bring me here, now I am an industrial engineer with data engineer experience that understands how important is set the correct flow of information to create value from analysis.</p>
